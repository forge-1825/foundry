# Release Notes

## v0.1.0-beta (2025-07-25)

### üéâ Initial Beta Release

We're excited to announce the first public beta release of Model Distillation Pipeline by Forge1825! This release provides the foundational infrastructure and web interface for distilling large language models into smaller, more efficient versions.

**Important**: This is an infrastructure release. Full pipeline functionality requires additional setup of vLLM model containers and configuration.

### ‚ú® Features

- **Pipeline Infrastructure**
  - Scripts for data extraction and enrichment
  - Teacher pair generation capabilities
  - Student model training framework
  - Model evaluation components
  - Multiple script versions for different approaches

- **Web-Based UI**
  - Real-time monitoring via WebSockets
  - Script configuration and execution interface
  - Results visualization components
  - System resource monitoring
  - File browser for outputs

- **Docker Integration**
  - Easy deployment with docker-compose
  - Containerized frontend and backend
  - Support for GPU acceleration
  - Volume mapping for data persistence

- **Model Support**
  - Teacher Model: Llama 3 (via vLLM)
  - Student Model: Phi-3 Mini 4K
  - OpenAI-compatible API endpoints
  - Remote model support via SSH forwarding

### üöß Known Limitations

- Test suite not yet implemented
- Limited error recovery in some pipeline steps
- Performance optimization needed for large datasets
- **Model containers not included** - must be set up separately
- Multiple script versions without clear usage documentation
- Pipeline workflow documentation needs improvement
- Some UI components need polish
- No sample data or example configurations provided

### üìã Requirements

- Docker Desktop with Docker Compose
- 16GB RAM minimum (32GB recommended)
- NVIDIA GPU (optional but recommended)
- ~10GB disk space for application and models

### üîß Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Run `docker-compose up -d`
4. Access the UI at http://localhost:3456
5. **Important**: Set up vLLM model containers separately (see documentation)

**What You Get**:
- A working web interface for script management
- Infrastructure for running distillation scripts
- Real-time monitoring of script execution
- Framework ready for your models

**What You Need to Add**:
- vLLM model containers (Teacher and Student models)
- Understanding of which scripts to use for your workflow
- Your own data for processing

See [SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md](SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md) for detailed setup guide.
