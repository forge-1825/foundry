## Security Best Practices

When using Model Distillation Pipeline:

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use `.env.example` as a template
- Keep sensitive configuration in environment variables
- Rotate API keys and secrets regularly

### Docker Security
- Keep Docker images updated
- Don't run containers as root when possible
- Use specific version tags rather than `latest`
- Scan images for vulnerabilities regularly

### Model Security
- Validate all inputs to models
- Be cautious with model outputs (sanitize before displaying)
- Monitor for adversarial inputs
- Keep model weights secure

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication for API endpoints
- Use firewalls to restrict access to services
- Monitor for unusual network activity

### Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure protocols for data in transit
- Implement proper access controls
- Regularly audit data access logs
