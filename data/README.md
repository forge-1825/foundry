# Model Distillation Pipeline Data Directory

This directory is used to store data files for the Model Distillation Pipeline Web UI.

## Directory Structure

The following subdirectories will be created as needed:

- **extracted/** - Contains data extracted by the manual_extractor.py script
  - JSON files with extracted content
  - PDF files of downloaded documents

- **enriched/** - Contains data enriched by the data_enrichment.py script
  - JSON files with cleaned text, extracted entities, and summaries

- **teacher_pairs/** - Contains teacher pairs generated by the teacher_pair_generation.py script
  - JSON files with input-target pairs

- **distilled_model/** - Contains the distilled model and training artifacts
  - Model checkpoints
  - Training metrics
  - Logs

- **configs/** - Contains saved configurations
  - JSON files with script configurations

- **history/** - Contains run history
  - JSON files with execution history and metrics

## Data Persistence

This directory is mounted as a volume in the Docker containers, ensuring that data persists across container restarts.

## Note

Large model files and datasets should be stored outside this directory and mounted separately to avoid performance issues.
