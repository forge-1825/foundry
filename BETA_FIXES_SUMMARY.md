# BETA Release Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes implemented for the BETA release.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Undefined post_enrichment_pipeline_selector
- **Issue**: Pipeline configuration referenced a non-existent script `run_post_enrichment_pipeline_selector.bat`
- **Fix**: Removed the undefined step from pipeline configuration in `backend/routes/pipeline_routes.py`
- **Result**: Pipeline now flows directly from content extraction to teacher pair generation

### 2. Created Essential Documentation

#### SCRIPT_VERSIONS_GUIDE.md
- Documents all script versions and their purposes
- Explains which scripts are active/deprecated/experimental
- Provides clear guidance on which version to use for different scenarios
- Located at: `scripts/SCRIPT_VERSIONS_GUIDE.md`

#### MODEL_SETUP_GUIDE.md
- Comprehensive instructions for setting up model containers
- Covers Docker, remote SSH, and manual vLLM setups
- Includes troubleshooting section for common issues
- Located at: `MODEL_SETUP_GUIDE.md`

#### PIPELINE_WORKFLOW.md
- Detailed explanation of how the pipeline works
- Step-by-step breakdown of each phase
- Data flow diagrams and file dependencies
- Located at: `PIPELINE_WORKFLOW.md`

#### BETA_RELEASE_NOTES.md
- Lists all known limitations and issues
- Provides setup requirements and prerequisites
- Includes security considerations and migration notes
- Located at: `BETA_RELEASE_NOTES.md`

### 3. Created Basic Test Suite
- Added pytest configuration (`tests/pytest.ini`)
- Created test fixtures and utilities (`tests/conftest.py`)
- Implemented smoke tests for imports (`tests/test_imports.py`)
- Added integration tests for model connectivity (`tests/test_model_connectivity.py`)
- Created unit tests for pipeline components (`tests/test_pipeline_components.py`)
- Added test runner script (`tests/run_tests.sh`)

Test categories:
- **Smoke tests**: Basic import and dependency checks
- **Integration tests**: Model and backend connectivity
- **Unit tests**: Component functionality verification

### 4. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages in `backend/app/vllm_client.py`
- Added specific error cases for common setup problems:
  - Connection errors with helpful troubleshooting steps
  - Timeout handling with clear messages
  - Model not found errors with guidance
  - Authentication failures

### 5. Updated README.md
- Added BETA release notice at the top
- Updated version to 1.0.0-beta
- Added links to all new documentation
- Clarified BETA status and limitations
- Renamed to "Foundry - Model Distillation Pipeline (BETA)"

## Testing the Fixes

Run the test suite:
```bash
# Quick smoke tests
./tests/run_tests.sh smoke

# All tests
./tests/run_tests.sh all

# With coverage
./tests/run_tests.sh coverage
```

## Next Steps

For future releases, consider:
1. Consolidating script versions into configurable options
2. Adding more comprehensive test coverage
3. Implementing progress indicators for long operations
4. Adding authentication to the web UI
5. Creating automated integration tests for the full pipeline
